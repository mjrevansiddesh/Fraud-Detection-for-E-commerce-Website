# Fraud-Detection-for-E-commerce-Website

E-commerce websites often transact huge amounts of money. And whenever a huge amount of money is moved, there is a high risk of users 
performing fraudulent activities, e.g. using stolen credit cards, doing money laundry, etc.

The goal of this Project is build a model that predicts whether a user has a high probability of using the site to perform some 
illegal activity or not. We only have information about the user first transaction on the site and based on that we have to make a 
classification ("fraud/no fraud").
